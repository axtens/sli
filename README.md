# sli
Script Language Interpreter

This project was originally written in [MoonRock BASIC](http://www.rowan.sensation.net.au/moonrock.html). 

> MoonRock is a BASIC-like language with several extensions. Produces small and tight executables (MS-DOS). 8086, 80186+ or 80386+ code. DOS real mode or DPMI protected mode. Archive includes compiler, ArrowSoft assembler, documentation and sample programs. 

It has been re-implemented in .NET Framework 

Example scripts also provided.

Probably an example of how **not** to build a DSL.

When a .sli script is run, a .trc (trace) file is also generated.
